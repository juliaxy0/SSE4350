Quality Attribute Assignment

Matric Number: 208256

1-	Calculate a software availability quality attribute percentage where ;

  	a.	The software is down 2 hours per day.
		22/24 X 100 = 91.67% availability
 	b.	The software is down 24 hours per week.
  		144/168 X 100 = 85.71% availability

2-	Identify the used security techniques for a Laravel or  DevExpress XAF for the following items:

  a.	Authentication
  	Laravel includes a User model in your app/models directory which may be used with the default Eloquent authentication driver. 
	When building the Schema for this Model, the password field is a minimum of 60 characters.
	
  b.	Authorization.
  
  	To log a user into your application, Auth::attempt is used method.
	
	if (Auth::attempt(array('email' => $email, 'password' => $password))) {
	    return Redirect::intended('dashboard');
	}
	
  c.	Encryption.
  
  	Laravel provides facilities for strong AES encryption via the mcrypt PHP extension:

	1) Encrypting A Value : $encrypted = Crypt::encrypt('secret');

	2) Decrypting A Value : $decrypted = Crypt::decrypt($encryptedValue);

	3) Setting The Cipher & Mode : 
		Crypt::setMode('ctr');
		Crypt::setCipher($cipher);
  
3-	Calculate the estimated performance throughput of a software where:
  a.	The average data per order in 1000 byte.
  b.	The upload bandwidth of the server is 1 mbps.

	Throughput = (1 x (1000x8) )/ 1 = 8 kbps

4-	Calculate the estimated performance response time of a software where:
  a.	The average data per screen in 500 byte.
  b.	The average number of users in 200.
  c.	The download bandwidth of the server is 1 mbps.

 	Tresponse = n/r - Tthink
		  = (200/ ((500x8)/1)) - 3
		  = 
    
5-	Regarding question number 4, how many server you need to add to your system in order to reduce response time to 1 sec.
