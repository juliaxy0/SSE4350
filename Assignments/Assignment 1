  a.	The software is down 2 hours per day.
  22/24 X 100 = 91.67% availability
  b.	The software is down 24 hours per week.

3-	Calculate the estimated performance throughput of a software where:
  a.	The average data per order in 1000 byte.
  b.	The upload bandwidth of the server is 1 mbps.

Throughput = (1 x (1000x8) )/ 1 = 8 kbps

4-	Calculate the estimated performance response time of a software where:
  a.	The average data per screen in 500 byte.
  b.	The average number of users in 200.
  c.	The download bandwidth of the server is 1 mbps.
  Average think time, Tthink, is three seconds per request.
  Tresponse = n/r - Tthink
		= (200/ (500x8))
    
5-	Regarding question number 4, how many server you need to add to your system in order to reduce response time to 1 sec.
